## 🧠 Overview  

**Rebelle** is a digital painting environment focused on reproducing the behavior of traditional art materials with exceptional accuracy. It simulates the interaction of water, pigment, canvas, and paper to deliver an organic painting experience that feels close to working with real-world tools.

Artists can explore watercolor diffusion, acrylic layering, oil blending, and dry media effects while maintaining full digital control. Each brush stroke reacts dynamically to surface texture and moisture, encouraging expressive and natural-looking results.

Rebelle is well suited for illustrators, concept artists, and painters who value authenticity alongside modern digital flexibility.
